# User Purchase Behavior Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project for analyzing user purchase behavior. The goal of the project is to uncover insights on spending patterns, identify key customer segments, and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance user retention and optimize marketing strategies.

## ✨ Features

- **📊 Purchase Pattern Analysis**: Evaluate total purchase amounts, purchase frequency, and lifetime value (LTV) to understand user spending behavior.
- **📈 Trend Analysis**: Identify monthly and yearly trends to pinpoint high and low spending periods.
- **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 User Segmentation**: Segment users based on demographics and spending levels to tailor marketing and product strategies.
- **📅 Seasonal Insights**: Discover seasonal trends to inform the timing of promotions and product launches.
- **🎯 Actionable Recommendations**: Generate insights that support data-driven strategies for improved user retention and increased revenue.

## 📦 Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the project:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`

To install all dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Input Data Format

The project expects an input dataset in CSV format with the following structure:

- **Features**: Columns representing individual user data, including demographics and purchase behavior.
- **Target Variable**: For specific analyses, such as identifying high-value customers, you may add a target variable as needed.

Ensure that column names are consistent with those used in the notebook or adjust them as necessary.

## 🏆 Results

Upon completion, the notebook provides:

- **User Purchase Insights**: Summary of user spending patterns, frequency of purchases, and key spending segments.
- **Trend Visualizations**: Graphs depicting monthly and yearly spending trends.
- **Segmentation and Demographic Analysis**: Visual breakdowns of spending by age, gender, and other demographic variables.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Data-driven suggestions for improving retention, targeting high-value customers, and timing seasonal promotions.

## 💾 Model Export

For predictive extensions, trained models or processed data can be saved for future use, supporting applications in customer lifetime value (LTV) prediction and customer segmentation.
